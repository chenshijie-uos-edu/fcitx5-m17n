This is the source tree of fcitx-m17n, some trivial little codes the wrap the
m17n input method engine into a fcitx input method.

Source Tree
===========

* im:
  Most codes.
* po:
  Translation files suitable for GNU gettext.
* testmim:
  A trivial standalone frontend to the m17n input methods engine.

Dependency, Building and Installation
=====================================

Fcitx-m17n is maintained using CMake. To install, run::

  mkdir build; cd build
  cmake .. [ FLAGS ] 
  make && make install

To install to /usr, include ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr`` in ``FLAGS``. To
build with debug symbols, include ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``. You may as well
replace ``cmake`` with ``ccmake``, which gives you a nice curses UI to adjust
CMake flags.

Dependencies is handled by CMake and therefore not listed here. But note that
testmim uses some C++11 features and requires a recent C++ compiler. Latest
clang will suffice.

You may want to read ``CMakeLists.txt`` in the subdirectories.
